This repository contains a custom Home Assistant component. You can easily install it using [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/).

## Overview

This custom Home Assistant integration implements a device to control an MSPA hot tub.  
It allows users to monitor and control various functions of their MSPA hot tub directly from Home Assistant, enabling automation and remote management.

Key features:
- Turn the hot tub on or off
- Adjust temperature settings
- Control bubbles and filtration
- Monitor current status and temperature

Refer to the installation and configuration instructions below to get started.

## Installation

1. **Add this repository to HACS:**
    - In Home Assistant, go to **HACS**.
    - Click the three dots in the top right and select **Custom repositories**.
    - Enter the URL of this repository and select **Integration** as the category.
    - Click **ADD**.

2. **Install the Integration:**

4. **Configure the Integration:**
    - Follow the documentation or configuration instructions specific to this component below.



## Configuration

After installation, you will need to configure the integration in Home Assistant. Before carrying out these steps it is recommended to 
create a guest account on the MSPA Link app to avoid using your main account credentials. Refer to the article here 
to create a guest account: [Creating a Guest Account in the MSPA Link App](MSPA_LINK.md).

To configure the MSPA integration in Home Assistant:
1. Go to **Settings** > **Devices & Services**.
2. Click on **Add Integration**.
3. Search for **mspa** and select it.
4. Enter the required information:
   - `email`: Your guest email for the MSPA account.
   - `password`: The MSPA account password for the guest user.

## Note

There are some limitations to this integration:
- It is not currently possible to determine which features your specific MSPA hot tub supports. If you find that some features, such as jet or ozone, do not work, it may be due to the specific model of your hot tub. You can disable the relevant entities in the Home Assistant UI.


## Troubleshooting

- Make sure you are running the latest version of HACS.
- Check the Home Assistant logs for any errors if the component does not load.
- Ensure that you have created and are using a guest account for Home Assistant with its own email and password in the MSPA Link app.
- you can only have one mspa integration per Home Assistant instance. If you have multiple MSPA hot tubs, you will need to set up separate instances of Home Assistant for each one.
